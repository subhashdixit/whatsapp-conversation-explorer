# Dependency versions and reproducible setup

This guide records the **maintained release** of `whatsapp-conversation-explorer`. Opening the published application requires a compatible browser; development installation uses the exact versions below.

## Runtime and tool versions

| Component | Exact version | Where enforced |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22.23.4 | `.nvmrc`, `package.json` engines, CI |
| npm | 10.9.9 | `packageManager`, engines, `engine-strict=true` |

## Install the same JavaScript environment

Install the Node version in `.nvmrc` (with its bundled npm). With nvm:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm ci
npm run check:dependencies
npm test
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Use `npm ci` to consume `package-lock.json` exactly. Plain `npm install` can update a lock during maintenance. The engine check rejects a different Node/npm combination. Windows users can install the same Node release and run the npm commands normally.

`package-lock.json` records every resolved npm package version, dependency placement and integrity hash. `dependency-versions.json` provides the same resolved-version index in a readable machine format.

## Browser implementation

The published application uses the browser’s native HTML/CSS/JavaScript APIs and repository-owned source modules. It has no separately installed browser framework or runtime library. npm dependencies are development/quality tools.

## Python

The maintained published app has no Python package environment. Any preserved original `requirements.txt` belongs to the historical prototype and is labelled accordingly; it is not installed by the Pages workflow.

## Scope and portability

The supported lockfiles, runtime files and asset identities describe the maintained application. Original prototype dependency lists are preserved as historical records; missing historical pins are not invented or represented as a tested environment.

Exact versions prevent silent dependency upgrades. Operating-system libraries, CPU architecture, browser features and native-wheel availability can still affect execution or floating-point results. Use the pinned interpreter, a compatible supported system and the checks above. Unsupported wheel platforms fail explicitly instead of silently compiling against unrecorded build dependencies.

External news/search APIs supply changing data independently of local package versions. Historical fixture data and model artifacts retain their repository identities. Future upgrades should change the exact version, corresponding lock/manifest and verification together in a reviewed PR.
